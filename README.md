# Smart Contract Attack Vectors

In this repository, we have a collection of known smart contract attack vectors, along with examples and prevention methods.

## Attacks

- [Front-Running AKA Transaction-Ordering Dependence](https://github.com/KadenZipfel/smart-contract-attack-vectors/blob/master/front-running.md)
- [Integer Overflow and Underflow](https://github.com/KadenZipfel/smart-contract-attack-vectors/blob/master/overflow-underflow.md)
- [Reentrancy](https://github.com/KadenZipfel/smart-contract-attack-vectors/blob/master/reentrancy.md)
- [Timestamp Dependence](https://github.com/KadenZipfel/smart-contract-attack-vectors/blob/master/timestamp-dependence.md)
- [DoS with (Unexpected) revert](https://github.com/KadenZipfel/smart-contract-attack-vectors/blob/master/dos-revert.md)
